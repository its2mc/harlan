  ;; This pass inserts vector bounds checks. So far we only support
  ;; this and allocation failures. The checking code for allocation
  ;; failures is inserted later, in uglify-vectors.
  ;;
  ;; The way we handle errors in kernels is going to drive us
  ;; completely insane someday, so here is a note to my future self to
  ;; hopefully lessen the pain. We support two kinds of errors, bounds
  ;; checks and allocation failures. To handle these, we add a
  ;; parameter to the kernel called the danger vector. Every
  ;; successful kernel thread should set their entry in the danger
  ;; vector to 0. If an error is detected, they fill the danger vector
  ;; with the correct error code and then return. The host code will
  ;; then iterate over the danger vector to make sure all the kernels
  ;; completed successfully.
  ;;
  ;; Now, you're probably wondering where all this code gets
  ;; generated. Well, the pass your looking at now inserts the array
  ;; bounds checks. The returnify-kernels pass is responsible for
  ;; adding the danger vector (errors are just a specially kind of
  ;; return, if you squint right). It gets better though. The
  ;; returnify-kernels pass also walks the whole AST and replaces all
  ;; the calls to (error ...) with code to fill the danger vector and
  ;; return. In this case, we've only ever generated array bounds
  ;; checks, so we just assume all of the error forms are bounds check
  ;; errors. So far so good.
  ;;
  ;; Next, we need to deal with the allocation errors. The types and
  ;; grammars are tricky to do this early on, and plus, we have lots
  ;; of allocating forms. Instead, we add the checks in
  ;; uglify-vectors. Basically, if alloc returns 0, there was a
  ;; failure to allocate. This generates new error forms, which won't
  ;; get erased from kernels in returnify-kernels like the ones from
  ;; remove-danger because returnify-kernels has already
  ;; run. Furthermore, by the time we get to uglify-vectors, it's hard
  ;; to figure out where the danger vector is. Instead we just punt
  ;; and let the error forms go to the end. Sadly, the expand into a
  ;; call to harlan_error, which OpenCL has no idea what to do with.
  ;;
  ;; But now, gpu_only.h has a macro called harlan_error which sets
  ;; the danger vector and returns. Since we know the only error forms
  ;; that made it that far are allocation failures, we set the danger
  ;; vector with the allocation failure code. But wait, didn't we just
  ;; say it's hard to find the danger vector after returnify-kernels?
  ;; Yes, we did. Well, the dirty little secret is that we decided to
  ;; always call it `danger` so the macro can find it.
  ;;
  ;; This is software engineering at its finest.
