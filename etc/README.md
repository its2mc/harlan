This directory includes an Emacs mode for editing Harlan source files.

The mode can be enabled by adding the following to your .emacs file:
```
(load-file "[path to Harlan repository]/etc/harlan-mode.el")
```

Additionally, this directory includes some python scripts for
generating plots from the results of Harlan benchmarks.
